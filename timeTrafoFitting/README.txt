There are two separate approaches in this folder: The one that actually works is based on "timeTrafoAna.m" and it's subfunctions.
The approach based on "findTrafoFit.m" works technically, but has numerical problems while fitting, at least for me (Tim) and I can not really get results from this.

As far as I can tell, only "timeTrafoAna.m" should be used, as it works practically as long as the pathing is correctly specified.
